        <h4><em>Jalapeno pig popper in a blanket</em></h4>
        <p>This blends the best of two worlds. Jalapeno poppers and pigs in a blanket. They aren't the traditional small size appetizers, so they're perfect for a satisfying snack. These get double jalapeno flavor with jalapeno-smoked sausage. If you want an even fancier presentation, use puff pastry. </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent roll dough </li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>Â½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste </li>
            <li>6 smoked jalapeno sausages, halved </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol type="I">
            <strong><li>Step 1</li></strong>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
            <strong><li>Step 2</li></strong>
            <p>Unwrap crescent dough and separate into 12 triangles onto a clean work surface. Spread 1 to 2 tablespoons cream cheese into each jalapeno half and press a sausage half into the mixture. Place stuffed jalapenos on top of the crescent triangles and sprinkle with 1 to 2 tablespoons Cheddar cheese. Wrap stuffed jalapeno with crescent dough.</p>
            <strong><li>Step 3</li></strong>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until dough has puffed up and is lightly browned, about 15 minutes.</p>
